# ðŸ’€ Executor

```toml
[dependencies]
executor = "0.1.0"
```
## Features
- [x] `#![no_std]` and minimally uses `alloc` (`Box` and `Arc`)
- [x] handle more than one spawn to parallelize work
- [x] simple enough to learn from!

## Example

```rust
use executor::Executor;

pub fn main() -> () {
    Executor::spawn(async {
        console_log("Hello");
        window_set_timeout(1000).await;
        console_log("World");
        window_set_timeout(1000).await;
        console_log("!");
    });
}
```
